# Number_plate_detection_using_imeage

This project demonstrates a computer vision application to detect and extract vehicle number plates from images using machine learning and optical character recognition (OCR).

Features
Detects the number plate from an input image.
Extracts the license plate text using OCR.
Example output shown with the input and detected text.
Input and Output
Input
An image of a vehicle with a number plate, such as:


Output
The detected number plate region and extracted text:

Project Files
num_pl_u_img.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation for number plate detection and OCR.
img1.jpeg: Example input image of a vehicle.
output.png: Example output image showing detection results.
Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

opencv-python
numpy
matplotlib
pytesseract
You can install them using pip:


pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib pytesseract
Usage
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-plate-detection.git
cd number-plate-detection
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook num_pl_u_img.ipynb
Run the notebook cells to see the detection process.

Implementation Steps
Image Preprocessing:
Convert input image to grayscale.
Apply filters and edge detection for clearer plate boundaries.
Number Plate Detection:
Use contours or a trained model to identify the plate region.
Text Extraction:
Extract text from the detected plate using Tesseract OCR.
Visualization:
Highlight the plate region and display the detected text.
Results
The project successfully detects the number plate and extracts the text accurately for most standard images.

Future Improvements
Implement real-time detection using a camera.
Train a custom object detection model for improved accuracy.
Enhance OCR processing for non-standard fonts or blurry images.
